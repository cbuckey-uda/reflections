When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    
    My most common use of remote repositories is when I'm collaborating with other
    people on a project.  I also use them when I want to share my code with someone,
    even if they just want to see my code and not contribute to it.  I also
    sometimes use them when I want to be able to edit code from multiple different
    computers and keep the code up-to-date on all the computers.  Also, remotes
    can be a good way to keep a backup of my work.
